"# Bayesian_Ground_Detection" 
This project included a data-greenhouse folder, which contains all images for training and testing.
There are a IPYNB File and a Python File. They both contain the same code.
Install Opencv using "!pip install opencv-python"
I would recommand open the IPYNB file using Jupyter NoteBook.
The Ground Region Detection Report pdf file is my report for this assignment.
